5.Cybersecurity
Software engineers design and implement security protocols, encryption algorithms, and monitoring systems to protect data and software from cyber threats.
They also develop tools for vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, and incident response.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s)
Overview: In the early days of computing, programs were written in machine code or assembly language, which was tedious and error-prone. The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959), and ALGOL (1960) revolutionized software development by allowing engineers to write code that was easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
Impact: High-level languages abstracted the complexities of hardware, enabling the development of more complex software and making programming more accessible to a broader range of people.
2. The Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
Overview: Structured programming introduced a methodology that emphasized the use of clear, logical control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. Notable languages from this era include Pascal (1970) and C (1972).
Impact: This approach reduced the complexity of software by promoting code modularity and clarity, leading to fewer errors and making programs easier to understand and maintain. The concept of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable modules became a cornerstone of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Communication 
Requirement Gathering
Feasibility Study
System Analysis 
Software Design 
Coding 
Testing 
Integration 
Operation and Maintenance
Disposition 


Communication 
This is the first step where the user initiates the request for a desired software product. He contacts the service provider and tries to negotiate the terms. He submits his request to the service providing organization in writing.

Requirement Gathering
This step onwards the software development team works to carry on the project. The team holds discussions with various stakeholders from problem domain and tries to bring out as much information as possible on their requirements. The requirements are contemplated and segregated into user requirements, system requirements and functional requirements. The requirements are collected using a number of practices as given -

studying the existing or obsolete system and software,
conducting interviews of users and developers,
referring to the database or
collecting answers from the questionnaires.
Feasibility Study
After requirement gathering, the team comes up with a rough plan of software process. At this step the team analyzes if a software can be made to fulfill all requirements of the user and if there is any possibility of software being no more useful. It is found out, if the project is financially, practically and technologically feasible for the organization to take up. There are many algorithms available, which help the developers to conclude the feasibility of a software project.

System Analysis
At this step the developers decide a roadmap of their plan and try to bring up the best software model suitable for the project. System analysis includes Understanding of software product limitations, learning system related problems or changes to be done in existing systems beforehand, identifying and addressing the impact of project on organization and personnel etc. The project team analyzes the scope of the project and plans the schedule and resources accordingly.

Software Design
Next step is to bring down whole knowledge of requirements and analysis on the desk and design the software product. The inputs from users and information gathered in requirement gathering phase are the inputs of this step. The output of this step comes in the form of two designs; logical design and physical design. Engineers produce meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams and in some cases pseudo codes.

Coding
This step is also known as programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently.

Testing
An estimate says that 50% of whole software development process should be tested. Errors may ruin the software from critical level to its own removal. Software testing is done while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at userâ€™s end. Early discovery of errors and their remedy is the key to reliable software.

Integration
Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases and other program(s). This stage of SDLC is involved in the integration of software with outer world entities.

Implementation
This means installing the software on user machines. At times, software needs post-installation configurations at user end. Software is tested for portability and adaptability and integration related issues are solved during implementation.

Operation and Maintenance
This phase confirms the software operation in terms of more efficiency and less errors. If required, the users are trained on, or aided with the documentation on how to operate the software and how to keep the software operational. The software is maintained timely by updating the code according to the changes taking place in user end environment or technology. This phase may face challenges from hidden bugs and real-world unidentified problems.

Disposition
As time elapses, the software may decline on the performance front. It may go completely obsolete or may need intense upgradation. Hence a pressing need to eliminate a major portion of the system arises. This phase includes archiving data and required software components, closing down the system, planning disposition activity and terminating system at appropriate end-of-system time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
